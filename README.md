## Demo

## Features

- Works using `:mksession` (`'sessionoptions'` is fully respected).
- Implements both global (from configured directory) and local (from current directory) sessions.
- No automated new session creation. Use `MiniSessions.write()` manually.
- Autoread default session (local if detected, else latest written global) if Neovim was called without intention to show something else.
- Autowrite currently read session before quitting Neovim.
- Configurable severity level of all actions.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.sessions').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Whether to read default session if Neovim opened without file arguments
  autoread = false,

  -- Whether to write currently read session before leaving it
  autowrite = true,

  -- Directory where global sessions are stored (use `''` to disable)
  directory = --<"session" subdir of user data directory from |stdpath()|>,

  -- File for local session (use `''` to disable)
  file = 'Session.vim',

  -- Whether to force possibly harmful actions (meaning depends on function)
  force = { read = false, write = true, delete = false },

  -- Hook functions for actions. Default `nil` means 'do nothing'.
  hooks = {
    -- Before successful action
    pre = { read = nil, write = nil, delete = nil },
    -- After successful action
    post = { read = nil, write = nil, delete = nil },
  },

  -- Whether to print session path after action
  verbose = { read = false, write = true, delete = true },
}
```
